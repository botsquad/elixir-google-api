defmodule GoogleApi.Speech.V2.Model.StreamingRecognitionResult do
  @moduledoc """
  A streaming speech recognition result corresponding to a portion of the audio that is currently being processed.

  ## Attributes

  *   `alternatives` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Speech.V2.Model.SpeechRecognitionAlternative.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - May contain one or more recognition hypotheses. These alternatives are ordered in terms of accuracy, with the top (first) alternative being the most probable, as ranked by the recognizer.
  *   `channelTag` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - For multi-channel audio, this is the channel number corresponding to the recognized result for the audio from that channel. For `audio_channel_count` = `N`, its output values can range from `1` to `N`.
  *   `isFinal` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If `false`, this StreamingRecognitionResult represents an interim result that may change. If `true`, this is the final time the speech service will return this particular StreamingRecognitionResult, the recognizer will not return any further hypotheses for this portion of the transcript and corresponding audio.
  *   `languageCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag of the language in this result. This language code was detected to have the most likelihood of being spoken in the audio.
  *   `resultEndOffset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time offset of the end of this result relative to the beginning of the audio.
  *   `stability` (*type:* `number()`, *default:* `nil`) - An estimate of the likelihood that the recognizer will not change its guess about this interim result. Values range from 0.0 (completely unstable) to 1.0 (completely stable). This field is only provided for interim results (is_final=`false`). The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating `stability` was not set.
